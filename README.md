# â†º SSQLite(Secure SQLite)

**`SSQLite`**, an abbreviation for Secure Sqlite, adds an additional layer to the `sqlite3` module by recording database modifications. This feature allows users to revert a specific query executed at any point in time. The logging mechanism is facilitated by a sophisticated data structure called **SSqliteQueryGraph** (SQG), which functions as a tree structure comprising nodes representing individual query statements. SQG not only tracks the queries that users intend to undo but also offers an efficient set of queries for data recovery. Consequently, users can now perform Point In Time Recovery (PITR) without executing irrelevant queries, resulting in significant savings in computing resources.

## Example

Suppose a user wants to undo a `DELETE` statement from the recorded history (6th query from the following example). This action may be prompted by an SQL injection attack, or it could just be the user's intention to rectify an erroneously inserted query from a previous point in time.

``` sql
1 CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));
2 INSERT INTO users(id, name) VALUES(1, 'Alice');
3 INSERT INTO users(id, name) VALUES(2, 'Bob');
4 UPDATE users SET name='April' WHERE id=1;
5 UPDATE users SET name='Aaron' WHERE id=1;
6 DELETE FROM users WHERE name='Aaron'; --> Target
7 INSERT INTO users(id, name) VALUES(3, 'Charles');
8 INSERT INTO users(id, name) VALUES(4, 'David');
9 UPDATE users SET name='Brendan' WHERE id=2;
(...and a bunch of more queries)
```

In previous approaches to performing Point In Time Recovery (PITR), it was necessary to either execute all queries preceding the target query or employ snapshot recovery methods. Subsequently, the user would need to execute all subsequent queries after the target query to maintain the most up-to-date state.

However, a more efficient approach would involve extracting only the relevant queries associated with the targeted query and generating a set of queries capable of reverting this subset of actions. In the example mentioned above, the relevant queries pertaining to the `DELETE` statement are as follows:

``` sql
2 INSERT INTO users(id, name) VALUES(1, 'Alice');
4 UPDATE users SET name='April' WHERE id=1;
5 UPDATE users SET name='Aaron' WHERE id=1;
```

The resulting "undo query set" can be represented by a single line of an INSERT statement, exemplifying how this approach can significantly conserve computational resources by skipping unnecessary actions.

``` sql
INSERT INTO users(id, name) VALUES(1, 'Aaron');
```

Unfortunately, the current version of **`SSQLite`** does not possess the ability to compress the "undo query set" in the aforementioned manner. Nonetheless, it is proficient in generating *quasi*-optimal solutions for each query statement, leading to time savings in the process. Our current version would generate the "undo query set" as the following:

``` sql
INSERT INTO X(id, name) VALUES(1, 'Alice');
UPDATE X SET name='Aaron' WHERE id=1;
```

## Run

A sample of running queries from a .sql file is as follows:

``` python
import ssqlite

ssqlite.executescript(
    db_name="test.db",
    sql_filename="test.sql",
    sqg_filename="test.sqg"
)
```

At present, the **`SSQLite`** implementation solely supports the executescript function, which serves as a wrapper. This function is responsible for executing all queries specified in a single text file. Additionally, it generates an accompanying `.sqg` file with the designated name, alongside the existing `.db` file.

Moreover, to verify the expected functionality of the recovery function for predefined test cases, simply execute the test.py file.

``` bash
$ python3 test.py
```

Upon running the test code, if the result is returned as `OK`, it indicates that the generation of the undo query set has been successful as anticipated. Additionally, you can examine each test case along with its corresponding expected results directly within the `test.py` file.
